                of intellectual property Outline of patents Higher categories: Property and Property law vte A trademark (also written trade mark or trade-mar is a type of intellectual property consisting of a recognizable sign, design, or expression
                that identifies products or services from a particular source and distinguishes them from others. The trademark owner can be an individual, business organization, or any legal entity. A trademark may be located on a package, a label, a
                voucher, or on the product itself. Trademarks used to identify services are sometimes called service marks </p>
            <p>The first legislative act concerning trademarks was passed in 1266 under the reign of Henry III, requiring all bakers to use a distinctive mark for the bread they sold. The first modern trademark laws emerged in the late 19th century. In France,
                the first comprehensive trademark system in the world was passed into law in 1857. The Trade Marks Act 1938 of the United Kingdom changed the system, permitting registration based on "intent-to-use", creating an examination based process,
                and creating an application publication system. The 1938 Act, which served as a model for similar legislation elsewhere, contained other novel concepts such as "associated trademarks", a consent to use the system, a defensive mark system,
                and a non claiming right system.
            </p>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>A trademark identifies the brand owner of a particular product or service. Trademarks can be used by others under licensing agreements; for example, Bullyland obtained a license to produce Smurf figurines; the Lego Group purchased a license
                from Lucasfilm to be allowed to launch Lego Star Wars; TT Toys Toys is a manufacturer of licensed ride-on replica cars for children.[6] The unauthorized usage of trademarks by producing and trading counterfeit consumer goods is known as
                brand piracy. The owner of a trademark may pursue legal action against trademark infringement. Most countries require formal trademark registration as a precondition for pursuing this type of action. The United States, Canada, and other
                countries also recognize common law trademark rights, which means action can be taken to protect any unregistered trademark if it is in use. Still, common law trademarks offer to the holder, in general, less legal protection than registered
                trademarks.
            </p>
            <h2>Designation and symbols</h2>
            <h4>A trademark may be designated by the following symbols:</h4>
            <li>™ (the "trademark symbol", which is the letters "TM" in superscript, for an unregistered trademark, a mark used to promote or brand goods)</li>
            <li>℠ (which is the letters "SM" in superscript,for an unregistered service mark, a mark used to promote or brand services) </li>
            <li>® (the letter "R" surrounded by a circle, for a registered trademark)</li>
            <p>The three symbols associated with trademarks represent the status of a mark and accordingly its level of protection. While ™ can be used with any common law usage of a mark, ® may only be used by the owner of a mark following registration
                with the relevant national authority, such as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or PTO) or Indian Patent Office (IPO). The proper manner to display either symbol is immediately following the mark in superscript style.</p>
            <h2>Styles</h2>
            <p>A trademark is typically a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements.[8] There is also a range of non-conventional trademarks comprising marks which do not fall into these standard categories, such
                as those based on colour, smell, or sound (like jingles). Trademarks that are considered offensive are often rejected according to a nation's trademark law.[9] The term trademark is also used informally to refer to any distinguishing attribute
                by which an individual is readily identified, such as the well-known characteristics of celebrities. When a trademark is used about services rather than products, it may sometimes be called a service mark, particularly in the United States.</p>


            <h2>Fundamental concepts</h2>
            <p>The essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the source or origin of products or services, so a trademark, properly called, indicates the source or serves as a badge of origin. In other words, trademarks serve to identify
                a particular entity as the source of goods or services. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark. Trademarks are used not only by businesses but also by noncommercial
                organizations and religions to protect their identity and goodwill associated with their name.[10][11][12] Trademark rights generally arise out of the use of, or to maintain exclusive rights over, that sign about certain products or services,
                assuming there are no other trademark objections. Different goods and services have been classified by the International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services into 45 Trademark Classes (1 to 34 cover goods, and 35 to 45 cover services).
                The idea behind this system is to specify and limit the extension of the intellectual property right by determining which goods or services are covered by the mark, and to unify classification systems around the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>Terms such as "mark", "brand" and "logo" are sometimes used interchangeably with "trademark". "Trademark", however, also includes any device, brand, label, name, signature, word, letter, numerical, shape of goods, packaging, color or combination
                of colors, smell, sound, movement or any combination thereof which is capable of distinguishing goods and services of one business from those of others. It must be capable of graphical representation and must be applied to goods or services
                for which it is registered.</p>
            <p>Specialized types of trademark include certification marks, collective trademarks and defensive trademarks. A trademark that is popularly used to describe a product or service (rather than to distinguish the product or services from those
                of third parties) is sometimes known as a genericized trademark. If such a mark becomes synonymous with that product or service to the extent that the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.
                A "trademark look" is an informal term for a characteristic look for a performer or character of some sort. It is usually not legally trademark protected and the term is not used in the trademark law</p>
            <h2>Registration</h2>
            <p>Some law considers a trademark to be a form of property. Proprietary rights about a trademark may be established through actual use of that trademark in the marketplace or through registration of the mark with the relevant trademarks office
                (or "trademarks registry") of a particular jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, trademark rights can be established through either or both means. Certain jurisdictions[which?] generally do not recognize trademarks rights arising merely
                through use. If trademark owners do not hold registrations for their marks in such jurisdictions, the extent to which they will be able to enforce their rights through trademark infringement proceedings may be limited. In cases of dispute,
                this disparity of rights is often referred to as "first to file" (i.e., register) as opposed to "first to use." Some countries, such as Germany, offer a limited number of common law rights for unregistered marks, where to gain protection
                the goods or services must first occupy a highly significant position in the marketplace — where this could be 40% or more market share for sales in the particular class of goods or services.</p>
            <p>In the United States, the registration process includes several steps. First, the trademark owner applies with the United States Patent and Trade Mark Office to register the trademark. About three months after it is filed, the application
                is reviewed by an examining attorney at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The examining attorney checks for compliance with the rules of the Trademark Manual of Examination Procedure. This review includes procedural matters such as
                making sure the applicant's goods or services are identified properly. It also includes more substantive matters such as making sure the applicant's mark is not merely descriptive or likely to confuse with a pre-existing applied-for or
                registered mark. If the application runs afoul of any requirement, the examining attorney will issue an office action requiring the applicant to address certain issues or refusals before registration of the mark. If the examining attorney
                approves the application, it will be "published for opposition." During this 30-day period, third parties who may be affected by the registration of the trademark may step forward to file an opposition proceeding to stop the registration
                of the mark. If an opposition proceeding is filed it institutes a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to determine both the validity of the grounds for the opposition as well as the ability of the applicant to register the
                mark at issue. Finally, provided that no third-party opposes the registration of the mark during the opposition period or the opposition is ultimately decided in the applicant's favor, the mark will be registered in due course.
            </p>

            <p>Outside of the United States, the registration process is substantially similar to that found in the U.S. save for one notable exception in many countries: registration occurs before the opposition proceeding. In short, once an application
                is reviewed by an examiner and found to be entitled to registration a registration certificate is issued subject to the mark being open to opposition. The overall length of the trademark registration process varies considerably between
                individual jurisdictions, from 2 to 24 months A registered trademark confers a bundle of exclusive rights upon the registered owner, including the right to exclusive use of the mark about the products or services for which it is registered.
                The law in most jurisdictions also allows the owner of a registered trademark to prevent unauthorized use of the mark about products or services which are identical or "colorfully similar" to existing registered products or services, and
                in certain cases, prevent the use of entirely dissimilar ones. The test is always whether a consumer of the goods or services will be confused as to the identity of the source or origin, not just the area of rights specified by the trademark.
                An example might be a very large multinational electronics brand such as Sony Corporation where a non-electronic product such as a pair of sunglasses might be assumed by a consumer to have come from Sony Corporation of Japan despite being
                outside a class of goods to which Sony has rights, yet still protected by Sony's trademark; a similarly named psychotherapy office or line of hamburger buns or summer camps, however, would not be infringing on Sony Corporation's trademark
                because the service or products being offered are so vastly different from Sony Corporation's trademark claim of rights and range of manufactured goods.
            </p>
            <p>Once trademark rights are established in a particular jurisdiction, these rights are generally only enforceable in that jurisdiction, a quality which is sometimes known as "territoriality". However, there is a range of international trademark
                laws and systems which facilitate the protection of trademarks in more than one jurisdiction.</p>

            <h4>Step 1: Trademark Search</h4>
            <li>Many entrepreneurs do not comprehend the importance of a TM search. Having a unique brand name in mind is not good enough reason to avoid a TM search. TM search helps you to know if there are similar trademarks available and it gives you a
                fair picture of where your trademark stands, sometimes, it also gives you a forewarning of the possibility of trademark litigation. Why waste your money in time-consuming trademark litigation later when you can choose to avoid it in the
                first place</li>
            <h4>Step 2: Filing Trademark Application</h4>
            <li>After you are sure that your chosen brand name or logo is not listed in the Trademark Registry India, you can opt for registering the same. The first step is to file a trademark application at the Trademark Registry India. Nowadays, filing
                is mostly done online. Once the application is filed, an official receipt is immediately issued for future reference</li>

                of affairs. Many a time, trademark (TM) owners end up in protracted litigation because when the time was right, they did not do trademark registration in India of their brand name. Trademark registration process of the brand name is not
                a difficult task. A few simple steps, as explained below and you would have the much-needed legal protection of your brand name registration in India. Step 1: Trademark Search Many entrepreneurs do not comprehend the importance of a TM
                search. Having a unique brand name in mind is not good enough reason to avoid a TM search. TM search helps you to know if there are similar trademarks available and it gives you a fair picture of where your trademark stands, sometimes,
                it also gives you a forewarning of the possibility of trademark litigation. Why waste your money in time-consuming trademark litigation later when you can choose to avoid it in the first place? Step 2: Filing Trademark Application After
                you are sure that your chosen brand name or logo is not listed in the Trademark Registry India, you can opt for registering the same. The first step is to file a trademark application at the Trademark Registry India. Nowadays, filing is
                mostly done online. Once the application is filed, an official receipt is immediately issued for future reference. Step 3: Examination After a trademark application is filed, it is examined by the examiner for any discrepancies. The examination
                might take around 12-18 months. The examiner might accept the trademark absolutely, conditionally or object. If accepted unconditionally, the trademark gets published in the Trademark Journal. If not accepted unconditionally, the conditions
                to be fulfilled or the objections would be mentioned in the examination report and a month's time would be given to fulfill the conditions or response to the objections. Once such response is accepted, the trademark is published in the
                Trademark Journal. If the response is not accepted, one can request a hearing. If in the hearing, the examiner feels that the trademark should be allowed registration, it proceeds for publication in the Trademark Journal.</li>
            <h4>Step 4: Publication</h4>
            <li>The step of publication is incorporated in the trademark registration process so that anyone who objects to the registering of the trademark has the opportunity to oppose the same. If, after 3-4 months from publication there is no opposition,
                the trademark proceeds for registration. In case there is opposition; there is a fair hearing and decision are given by the Registrar.
            </li>
            <h4>Step 5: Registration Certificate</h4>
            <li>Once the application proceeds for trademark registration, following publication in Trademark Journal, a registration certificate under the seal of the Trademark Office is issued.</li>
            <h4>Step 6: Renewal</h4>
            <li>The trademark can be renewed perpetually after every 10 years. Hence, your logo or brand name registration can be protected perpetually. As seen from the above, trademark registration in India process does not require much effort. It is a
                simple process but one which is nonetheless very important for brand name registration. We, at Intepat, can help you with the entire process of registration without you worrying about deadlines and responses. Hence, understand the power
                of your brand name registration and take steps in protecting it today.</li>
            <h2>Incontestable status</h2>
            <p>Specifically, once registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the owner of a trademark is required to file a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use to maintain the registration between the 5th and 6th year anniversaries of the registration
                of the mark or during the 6-month grace period following the 6th anniversary of the registration.[39] During this period, a trademark owner may concurrently opt to file a Section 15, Declaration of Incontestability. A mark declared incontestable
                is immune from future challenge, except in instances where the mark becomes generic, the mark is abandoned, or if the registration was acquired fraudulently. Note, if the Section 8 Affidavit is filed during the 6-month grace period additional
                fees to file the Affidavit with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will apply.[40] In addition to the requirements above, U.S. trademark registrations are also required to be renewed on or about every 10th anniversary of the registration
                of the trademark. The procedure for 10-year renewals is somewhat different from that for the 5th–6th year renewal. In brief, registrants are required to file both a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use as well as a Section 9 Application
                for Renewal every ten years to maintain their registration.</p>
            <h2>Licensing</h2>
            <p>Licensing means the trademark owner (the licensor) grants a permit to a third party (the licensee) to commercially use the trademark legally. It is a contract between the two, containing the scope of content and policy. The essential provisions
                to a trademark license identify the trademark owner and the licensee, in addition to the policy and the goods or services agreed to be licensed.</p>
            <p>Most jurisdictions provide for the use of trademarks to be licensed to third parties. The licensor must monitor the quality of the goods being produced by the licensee to avoid the risk of the trademark being deemed abandoned by the courts.
                A trademark license should therefore include appropriate provisions dealing with quality control, whereby the licensee provides warranties as to the quality and the licensor has rights to inspection and monitoring.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>Trademark owners and applications enjoy many protections. The IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Center for example has the message of "protection is our trademark" and is one example of an office that will enforce and protect the marks when
                needed.
