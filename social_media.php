        <h1 class="text-center" style="color: rgb(50, 50, 151);">What Is Social Media Marketing?</h1>
        <p>
            Enough has already been said about social media, how it reshapes consumer behavior, and how organizations
            can use it to turn the wheel of fortune in its favor.
        </p>
        Despite the massive amount of information on the web, so many businesses struggle to wrap their head around
        “social media marketing” and how it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I decided to come up with a comprehensive guide that will simplify social media marketing for those
            struggling to develop successful marketing strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social media is a network of over 3.5 billion users that just love to share, seek, and create information.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a marketer or business owner, how could you utilize this network in a way that produces great results for
            your business?
        </p>
        <p>
            Social media channels have rapidly become an inseparable part of business development strategies. You can’t
            overlook the impact of “social” when it comes to building meaningful connections with consumers.
        </p>
        <h3>What ls Social Media Marketing?</h3>
        Here is how Investopedia defines the term:
        <p>
            “Social media marketing (SMM) is the use of social media websites and social networks to market a company’s
            products and services.”
        </p>
        <p>
            But this definition is missing something really important. Let’s make it more simple and clear:
        </p>
        <p>
            “Social media marketing is the process of creating tailored content for each social media platform to drive
            engagement and promote your business.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Social media marketing is all about connecting with your audience or customers and helping them understand
            your brand better. It is incredibly beneficial to your business growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine you’re going to meet someone for the first time with an intention to build a good relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
            What should you do to make that person like you instantly because you’re not going to get a second chance?
            Will you succeed if you meet that person and say things that are boring or meaningless?
        </p>
        <p>
            People tend to like you more when you make them happy, no matter how you do that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like the offline world, your social media marketing success largely depends on your ability to find and
            make your target audience happy so that they like your brand and share your stories with others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your social media marketing efforts will produce no results if your story isn’t worth sharing.
        </p>i
        <h2>Why Is Socal Media Marketing Important Today?</h2>
        <p>
            Today's consumers rush to browse social media when they want to know more about an organization or product
            because that’s where they’ll find others talking about that business.
        </p>
        <p>
            What if you don’t have a social media presence? You’ll miss a great opportunity to make an impression.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take a look at these stats from Oberlo to have a feel of why having a sound social media marketing strategy
            is imperative to business success in 2020 and beyond:
        </p>
        <p>
            71% of consumers who have had a positive experience with a brand on social media are likely to recommend the
            brand to their friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
            90.4% of Millennials, 77.5% of Generation X, and 48.2% of Baby Boomers are active social media users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Facebook alone has over 2.7 billion monthly active users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your customers and prospects are using social media channels every single day, multiple times a day. Check
            out this blog to know how much time an average person spends on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social media is an ideal place for brands looking to gain insights into their audience’s interests and
            tastes. The way experts see it, smart companies will continue to invest in social media to achieve
            sustainable business growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you want to launch a new product or a business, social media is the perfect launchpad to create a
            buzz around your initiatives. As we move further into the future of e-commerce, it’s clear that social media
            marketing isn’t just an option.
        </p>
        <p>
            In an increasingly competitive environment, your business can’t afford to miss out on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's especially competitive in the social media influencer space, where there are thousands of new
            influencers starting a brand every day. If you're trying to build more of an online presence to become a
            social media influencer, make sure to read our comprehensive guide.

        <h2>Benefits Of Social Media Marketing</h2>
        <p>
            The concept of social media marketing has evolved over the years. A few years ago, the sole purpose of using
            social media channels was to generate website traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, it has developed into something more than just a place to broadcast content.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can have a social media marketing strategy in place to achieve a broad range of benefits from creating
            two-way conversations with potential customers to expand the reach of whatever you’re selling. I am going to
            mention the top 5 benefits of social media marketing:
        </p>
        1 <h3> SMM Consistently Warms Up A New Audience For Your Business</h3>
        <p>
            How to be a social media influencer
        </p>
        <p>


            There’s nothing worse than facing a cold audience or people who haven't interacted with your brand before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social media marketing opens up doors to tools and tactics that make it easy to warm up a new audience for
            your business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Facebook and other social platforms allow you to use content to connect with the potential audience and warm
            them up. While it’s hard to get people’s attention, you can easily break through the noise with engaging
            content.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, creating an interesting Facebook video ad can drive people to know more about you.
        </p>
        2. <h3>SMM Builds Stronger Relationships With Customers</h3>
        If you think social media marketing is all about selling and promoting, rethink.
        </p>
        <p>
            Successful brands connect and engage with their social media audiences to build lasting relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, when they share something on a platform, they respond to whoever leaves a comment or question
            to provide them any assistance they may need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than selling your products or services, you can simply ask your social media followers questions
            about your products or share something that could make life easier for your audience.
        </p>
        <p>
            This way, you build trust and show them how much you care about their needs and opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's always a must to serve people first before asking them to invest with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, one of our best social media strategies that we use is our Entrepreneur Cooperative Facebook
            Community.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use this Facebook group as a place to talk about life and business, share cool thoughts and strategies,
            and really just get to know other like-minded people like us.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Facebook group is a great way to use social media to grow a loyal audience of people who will advocate for
            your business or brand for a lifetime.
        </p>

        3. <h3> SMM Generates More Leads & Conversions</h3>
        Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Linkedin allows companies to generate leads. You can use a mix
        of paid and organic tactics to boost conversions.
        <p>
            Video marketing, paid ad campaigns, giveaways, and email opt-ins are some of the leading strategies to get
            prospects into your sales funnel.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, running a giveaway campaign on Facebook can help you boost your list of qualified email
            addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since everything happens online, SMM is a measurable, quicker, and easier way to build a database of
            prospects. With increased visibility, your business finds plenty of opportunities for conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compelling content can lead your social media followers to your company’s website and turn them into loyal
            customers.
        </p>
        4. <h3>SMM Gives You A Leg Up On Competitors</h3>

        <p>
            How to find your competitors
        </p>

        <p>
            There’s a lot to learn from your competitors’ social media presence, especially if you have just started
            exploring social media and lack good marketing ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Progressive companies always monitor their competition to see what’s working for them and whatnot. Tracking
            what your competitors are up to should be a key part of your social media marketing strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can start experimenting with things that are working for your competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if paid Facebook ads are generating good results for your competitors, you should try it too.
            However, you shouldn’t copy your competition in a way that could hurt your reputation. Make sure to stand
            out.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to see what type of Facebook ads your competitors are showing their audience, you can see
            everything they are doing by visiting Facebooks ad library, here.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ad library provides advertising transparency by offering a comprehensive, searchable collection of all
            ads currently running from across Facebook apps and services, including Instagram.
        </p>
        5. <h3>SMM Is Cost-Effective</h3>
        </p>
        Social media marketing is probably the most cost-efficient and diverse way of promoting a business.
        </p>
        <p>
            It doesn’t cost anything to create a profile on most social networking sites. In case you want to run a paid
            campaign to boost your content, the cost is relatively low as compared to other advertising platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            When done well, your chances of producing greater returns on your investment are higher. If paid advertising
            is a part of your social media marketing strategy, be sure to start small and work your way up as you become
            more comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
            There’s always something you can do to improve your digital advertising results. One of the benefits of
            social media marketing is that it allows you to track your performance and fine-tune your strategy using
            real-time data
        </p>
        <h3> The Application Of #R3MAT Method In Social Media Marketing</h3>
        <p>
            While social media can produce numerous benefits for businesses, it’s important to have a result-oriented
            strategy in place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we dive into explaining how to create a successful social media marketing strategy, let’s find out
            what #R3MAT has to do with your marketing efforts.
        </p>


        <h2>how to do social media marketing</h2>


        </p>
        Today, digital marketers have to create personalized experiences across channels. While growth possibilities are
        endless, you have to consistently deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time (#R3MAT).
        </p>
        <p>
            Your marketing efforts could go down the drain if you fail to deliver the right context.
        </p>
        <p>
            Context matters
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned earlier, more than 3 billion people use social media around the world. These people have dozens
            of moments that create billions of signals which include both context and intent.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be more relevant and effective, you need to make sure the context is clear. In other words, you need to
            understand the psychology of what people do when they use a particular platform. People use different social
            media channels with a different mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is your audience looking for when they are on Facebook? Does your content on Facebook reflect your
            audience’s needs and interests?
        </p>
        <p>Be sure to take into account the context when creating content, and don’t interrupt the user experience.
            Reach people at the right time and with the right message in a way that adds value to their overall
            experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is a 7-step plan to develop a winning social media marketing strategy:
        </p>
        <h2>Step 1: Set Clear Goals And Metrics</h2>
        <p>What do you want to gain from your social media presence? Whether you want to increase your reach with
            followers or earn more dollars and cents, clearly define your goals and metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why is your company active on social media in the first place? Without having a clear goal in your mind, you
            won’t be able to determine the right direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, set your goals using the S.M.A.R.T goal framework, which means each of your goals should be:
        </p>
        <p>
            Specific: the more specific you are with your goals, the easier it will be to set a clear strategy and
            expectations. If you want to increase brand awareness, be specific on how you want to do that. Let’s say
            your goal is to increase your Instagram following by 250 new followers per month.
        </p>
        <p>
            Measurable: When you set specific goals, it becomes easier to measure your success. If you’re not getting
            250 new followers per month, you can tweak your strategy to improve results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Attainable: Sometimes companies get too ambitious and end up setting unrealistic, unattainable goals. Be
            sure your target is achievable given your resources. Now, it’s quite attainable to generate 250 new
            followers on Instagram.
        </p>
        <p>
            Relevant: How your social media marketing goals are going to impact your bottom line? Will increasing your
            Instagram following help you achieve your business goals? Relevant goals are aligned closely to a business’s
            objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time-bound: Make sure to set deadlines. Again, be realistic when doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
            It might be difficult to find out how much value the increase in your social media following would bring to
            the table. Therefore, it’s advisable to focus on metrics like conversion rates, click-through, and
            engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may set different goals for each social media network and track your performance accordingly.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Research Target Audience</h3>


        <h2>What is social media marketing</h2>


        </p>
        <p>
            Learn as much about your audience as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your social media target audience is a group of people who are most likely to be interested in your
            business. They would share common demographics and behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you research your target audience, don’t hesitate to be highly specific. It will allow you to get into
            finer details and craft relevant content.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can’t target everyone. Or, your target audience is not everyone active on social media, especially when
            you run a small business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are a couple of steps to identify and target the right audience:
        </p>
        <p>
            Create audience personas
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating audience personas is about developing a fictional representation of your ideal customers. In other
            words, personas draw a clear picture of your perfect customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether your audience is baby boomers or millennials, high school students, or senior citizens, create a
            persona to hone in on a more actionable, focused strategy. Use factors like age, location, language, average
            income, interests, spending power, and pain points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s say your audience is a group of single moms in their late 20s who live in big cities and do a
            full-time job. Take these abstract collections of demographics and characteristics to create a persona.
        </p>
        Use data
        </p>Don’t just assume things when researching your target audience. Instead, use data to make well-informed
        decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s say your target audience is millennials.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, use data to select the right social media channels for your strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social media analytics gives you tons of actionable information about who your followers are, what they do,
            where they live, and how they interact with businesses on social media. Use these insights to better
            identify your audience.
        </p>
        <h3> 3: Research Competitors</h3>
        <p>Your competitors are using social media.
        </p>
        Aren’t they?
        </p>
        <p>
            Dig deep into what your competition is up to.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can gain valuable insight by simply reviewing your competitors’ social presence. Competitors analysis
            tools can be of great help in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conduct a competitive analysis
        </p>
        <p>There’s a lot you can learn from your competitors; for example, what strategies are and aren’t working for
            them.
        </p>
        <p>
            A competitive analysis not only identifies your competitors but also gives you a good sense of what you can
            expect from your social presence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow these steps to have a clear picture of who you’re competing against:
        </p>
        <p>
            Identify your competitive keywords: prepare a list of relevant keywords with data on competition and search
            volume. These keywords will help you narrow your definition of competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Find out who’s ranking for your targeted keywords: Select the top 10 keywords that are most relevant to your
            business. Plug them into Google to find your top competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Browse social using your keywords: Now use your top keywords to see who comes up top in social results. For
            instance, plug those keywords in the Facebook search bar to see who shows up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Find out brands your audience is following: Twitter Analytics and Facebook Audience Insights help marketers
            find what other brands their audience follows.
        </p>
        <p>
            You would be able to build a long list of potential customers after trying these techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, narrow your list down to only five brands that are most closely competing with you on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then you can perform a SWOT analysis to analyze your business and the competition in terms of strengths,
            weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Analyzing the way your competitors are using social media to boost business growth will help you spot
            opportunities. This doesn’t mean you need to copycat your competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your competitors focus largely on Facebook, for example, you might try other networks where your audience
            is underserved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pro Tip: Watch the comments and reviews of your competitors’ social media pages to see what their customers
            are complaining about or requesting. Social listening is an effective way to keep an eye on your
            competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you figure that out, go and create content on those specific requests and close the gap. This gives you
            a major advantage over your competitors.
